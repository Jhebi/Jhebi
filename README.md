Hi I'm **John**, currently living in the Philippines

While I have a newfound passion for programming, I'm still currently looking for what branch of programming do I really want to focus on.
This is why if you'll browse my repositories, it's going to be filled with all sorts of random projects. I am still currently searching for
what I really want to focus on as a software developer.

Willing to work as an apprentice in order to learn more in becoming a software developer myself. I'm still currently studying in college with 
1 year left before getting my Bachelor's Degree.
